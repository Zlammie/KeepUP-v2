      <p>
        Thank you for participating in this test run of Keep Up CRM. The goal is to keep the experience
        user friendly while still providing the tools a Community Sales Manager and their team need. Additional
        features - especially around task creation and activity tracking - are already on the roadmap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this is still an early build, you may encounter bugs. Please avoid relying on it as your sole
        source of record for leads until we harden the data workflows. If something breaks, grab the console log
        (F12 in most browsers) and send the details to <a href="mailto:zlammie@gmail.com">zlammie@gmail.com</a>.
        I can review the issue directly - either from the console output or by inspecting your account data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, have fun. Try the features, push the limits, and let me know what ideas you have.
        If hosting costs start to creep up, I may ask you to ease off, but otherwise go wild. Thanks again for
        helping shape Keep Up CRM!
      </p>

      <h1 class="h3">Update Notes</h1>

      <article class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5 mb-2">Version 1.0.3 - Pending Release</h2>

        <p class="mb-1 fw-semibold">Major Updates</p>
        <ul class="mb-3">
          <li>You can now link a company community to yours to treat it as a competitor. Most fields auto-populate, with shared data across both communities. (Sales / QMI data appears only if the other team keeps their specs updated.)</li>
          <li>Contact status can be updated directly on the table view—no need to open the detail drawer first.</li>
          <li>Closing date and time inputs were added to Address Details, and the closing status logic now works end-to-end.</li>
          <li>The lender table pulls every linked contact, with a new Purchasers table that allows editing closing date, time, and status.</li>
          <li>Contacts table now includes a search bar and supports adding a new contact inline without visiting the Add Lead form.</li>
          <li>Realtor table displays both contact status and lender status.</li>
          <li>View Lots closing column renders date + time and has styled status filters; hover helpers describe the walk dots.</li>
          <li>Sales price and list price in Contact Details and Address Details now render with currency formatting.</li>
          <li>Added a Purchased tab that lists contacts with a linked lot who haven’t closed yet, along with a progress tracker for managing closings.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-1 fw-semibold">UI Polish</p>
        <ul class="mb-3">
          <li>Manage My Community Competition layout matches the Update Competition page.</li>
          <li>Address Details date inputs were refreshed to match the current design system.</li>
          <li>My Community Competition header now features a styled Manage Communities button and a redesigned community selector.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-1 fw-semibold">Bug Fixes</p>
        <ul class="mb-3">
          <li>Access controls tightened: you’ll only see leads and community info that are linked to your communities (with unassigned leads still visible to their creator).</li>
          <li>Building status updates immediately on Address Details.</li>
          <li>View Lots reliably displays closing date and time pulled from the linked purchaser.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-1 fw-semibold">Alerts</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Attempting to link a competitor without selecting a community now shows an alert so you don’t lose your place.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5 mb-2">Version 1.0.2 - 10/21/2025</h2>
        <p class="mb-1 fw-semibold">My Community Details</p>
        <ul class="mb-3">
          <li>Linked floor plans now populate the "Model Floor Plan" selector.</li>
          <li>Competition cards pull the company name directly.</li>
          <li>Competition graphs expand to fill more horizontal space.</li>
          <li>Added a new base-price vs sqft comparison chart for your community.</li>
          <li>QMI/SOLD chart now renders as a pure scatter without connecting lines.</li>
          <li>Base price chart focuses strictly on your community (competitors removed).</li>
          <li>PID / MUD inputs render without forcing a page refresh and include a frequency selector.</li>
          <li>Linked competitor UI clarifies which communities are connected vs available.</li>
          <li>Added amenity options and refreshed hide/show controls for Promotions, HOA, and Pros & Cons.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-1 fw-semibold">Competition Dashboard</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Quick Move-In / Sold legend redesigned for clarity.</li>
          <li>My Community header resized to keep more linked builder pills on a single row.</li>
        </ul>
