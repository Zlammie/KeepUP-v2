  <p>Thank you for participating in this test run of Keep Up CRM. My goal with this program was to try to make it as user friendly as possible
    while still being robust enough to meet the originzation needs of a Community Sales Manager and their team. I am planning on adding more features
    to help with creating task and managing certain activities. 
  </p>
  <p>With that being said this is just in its early phases and while it is mostly working there are going to be bugs. I would not rely on it
    100% for managing leads as I cannot gurantee we will not have an issue with data loss or coruption. This is meant to be a test for you to play around
    and test features to see if it is something that you see yourself benefiting from and using on a day to day basis. If you run into any issues
    please email me at zlammie@gmail.com, you should be able to hit F12 to enter the console and copy the errors you see there by clicking right
    in the console window, copy and paste them in an email and I'll resolve the issue. I can also log into your account to see if there is an issue
    with how the data was entered from your side or if there is missing data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other than that go nuts, I want to see what breaks, so test anything out you feel like. If it gets to expensive from my end I'll let you
    know to cool your jets since I do have to pay for data storage and hosting. Feel free to let me know if you have any ideas on what I can improve.
    
    Thanks again for helping me test this out, I really appreciate it.
    -Zach
