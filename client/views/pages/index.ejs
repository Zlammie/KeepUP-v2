      <p>
        Thank you for participating in this test run of Keep Up CRM. The goal is to keep the experience
        user friendly while still providing the tools a Community Sales Manager and their team need. Additional
        features - especially around task creation and activity tracking - are already on the roadmap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this is still an early build, you may encounter bugs. Please avoid relying on it as your sole
        source of record for leads until we harden the data workflows. If something breaks, grab the console log
        (F12 in most browsers) and send the details to <a href="mailto:zlammie@gmail.com">zlammie@gmail.com</a>.
        I can review the issue directly - either from the console output or by inspecting your account data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, have fun. Try the features, push the limits, and let me know what ideas you have.
        If hosting costs start to creep up, I may ask you to ease off, but otherwise go wild. Thanks again for
        helping shape Keep Up CRM!
      </p>
